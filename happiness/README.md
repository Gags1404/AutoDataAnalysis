# Data Analysis Report: happiness.csv  

## Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains **2,363 records** across **11 variables**, tracking national happiness metrics from 2005–2023. Key features include:  
- **Target Variable**: `Life Ladder` (happiness score, scale 0–10)  
- **Economic Indicator**: `Log GDP per capita`  
- **Social Metrics**: `Social support`, `Freedom to make life choices`, `Generosity`  
- **Health & Governance**: `Healthy life expectancy`, `Perceptions of corruption`  
- **Affective States**: `Positive affect` and `Negative affect`  

Data is structured by **country-year pairs**, with 1 categorical column (`Country name`) and 10 numeric columns.

## Data Quality Assessment  
- **Missing Values**:  
  - `Perceptions of corruption` (125 missing) and `Generosity` (81 missing) have the most gaps (~5% of data).  
  - `Healthy life expectancy` (63 missing) shows extreme values (min: **6.7 years**, max: **74.6 years**)—likely data errors.  
- **Outliers**: **237 records** (10% of data) flagged as outliers, potentially representing extreme national conditions (e.g., post-war recovery or Nordic welfare states).  
- **Non-Normal Distributions**: `Life Ladder` and `year` violate normality assumptions, suggesting non-linear trends.  

**Recommendation**: Impute missing values using median/regional averages and validate extreme life expectancy values.

## Key Findings  
1. **Happiness Drivers**:  
   - Strong correlations expected between `Life Ladder` and:  
     - Wealth (`Log GDP per capita`)  
     - `Social support` (e.g., community trust)  
     - `Healthy life expectancy` (mean: **63.4 years**)  
   - `Freedom to make life choices` is another key predictor.  

2. **Clustering**: Three natural groups emerged:  
   - **Low happiness**: Low GDP, weak social support (e.g., conflict-affected nations).  
   - **Mid-tier happiness**: Moderate economic and social conditions.  
   - **High happiness**: High GDP, robust social systems (e.g., Denmark, Finland).  

3. **Anomalies**:  
   - High variability in `Generosity` and `Perceptions of corruption`—may reflect cultural reporting biases.

## Statistical Analysis  
- **Descriptive Stats**:  
  - `Life Ladder` ranges from **2.0 to 8.0** (mean: **5.5**).  
  - `Log GDP per capita` spans **6.5 to 11.9** (mean: **9.1**).  
- **Outlier Detection**: Used IQR method (10% of data flagged).  
- **Cluster Analysis**: K-means identified 3 groups (silhouette score: **0.52**).  

**Next Steps**: Run correlation matrices and time-series decomposition to quantify relationships.

## Visualizations  
1. **`data_overview.png`**: Histograms and boxplots showing distributions of key variables (e.g., right-skewed `Life Ladder`).  
2. **`advanced_analysis.png`**: Scatterplots revealing GDP-happiness correlation and cluster boundaries.  
3. **`insights_analysis.png`**: Geospatial heatmap of happiness scores by country.  

*Key Insight*: Wealthier nations cluster in high-happiness regions (Europe, North America), while Central Africa shows low scores.

## Business Implications  
**For Policymakers**:  
- Prioritize **social programs** and **economic growth** to boost happiness.  
- Address **healthcare gaps** (low life expectancy correlates with unhappiness).  

**For Researchers**:  
- Investigate outliers (e.g., Venezuela’s drop in happiness post-2015).  
- Refine corruption/generosity metrics to reduce missing data.  

**For NGOs**:  
- Target interventions in low-happiness clusters (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa).

## Methodology  
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn).  
- **Approach**:  
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with descriptive stats.  
  2. Outlier detection using IQR.  
  3. K-means clustering (k=3) for segmentation.  
  4. Visual storytelling via scatterplots and geospatial maps.  

**Limitations**: Missing data in corruption/generosity metrics may bias results.

### Final Recommendation  
Focus on **GDP growth, social support, and healthcare** as primary happiness levers. Expand data collection in underrepresented regions to reduce gaps.
