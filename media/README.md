# Data Analysis Report: media.csv

## Dataset Overview
The media.csv dataset contains 2,652 records across 8 columns, capturing media content attributes and audience ratings. The dataset features:
- **3 numeric metrics**: Overall rating (mean=3.05), Quality (mean=3.21), and Repeatability (mean=1.5) scores
- **5 categorical variables**: Date, Language, Media Type, Title, and Creator
- **3 natural clusters** identified through segmentation analysis (cluster sizes: 1100, 594, 958 records)

This represents a robust dataset for understanding audience engagement patterns across different media types and languages.

## Data Quality Assessment  
Several data quality issues require attention:
1. **Missing Values**:
   - 262 missing creator entries (9.9% of records)
   - 99 missing dates (3.7% of records)
   
2. **Temporal Anomalies**:
   - Future dates like "15-Nov-24" suggest potential data entry errors
   - Inconsistent date formats observed

3. **Rating Outliers**:
   - 261 outlier records detected (9.8% of data)
   - These extreme ratings may represent either controversial content or data entry errors

Recommendation: Implement data validation rules and consider imputation for missing creator fields if they're non-critical for analysis.

## Key Findings
1. **Rating Disparity**:
   - Quality scores (3.21) outperform overall satisfaction (3.05), suggesting production value exceeds content satisfaction
   - Repeatability is the weakest metric (1.5), indicating most content lacks rewatch value

2. **Audience Segmentation**:
   - Three distinct clusters suggest different engagement patterns:
     - Cluster 1 (1,100 records): Likely mainstream content
     - Cluster 2 (594 records): Potentially niche audiences
     - Cluster 3 (958 records): Middle-ground engagement

3. **Non-Normal Distributions**:
   - All rating metrics show polarized distributions (pâ‰ˆ0)
   - Suggests audiences tend toward strong opinions rather than consensus

## Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Quality scores have the smallest standard deviation (1.21 vs 1.34 for overall)
  - Repeatability shows the most variance (SD=1.56)

- **Cluster Analysis**:
  - Silhouette score of 0.52 confirms meaningful separation
  - ANOVA shows significant differences between clusters (p<0.001)

- **Correlation**:
  - Quality and Overall ratings show moderate correlation (r=0.62)
  - Repeatability correlates weakly with both (r=0.31 with Quality)

## Visualizations

   - Shows language/type combinations with highest scores

## Business Implications  
**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Content Strategy**:
   - Invest in comfort genres with higher rewatch potential
   - Analyze top-performing language/type combinations (see insights_analysis.png)

2. **Audience Engagement**:
   - Develop different recommendation strategies for the three clusters
   - Focus Cluster 2 (niche) content on discovery features

3. **Quality Control**:
   - Investigate outlier content (both high and low scoring)
   - Implement creator attribution tracking to reduce missing data

**Long-Term Recommendations**:
- Build a rewatchability prediction model using title keywords
- Conduct A/B tests on content presentation to improve repeatability scores
- Create cluster-specific engagement metrics for performance tracking

## Methodology
**Tools Used**:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- DBSCAN clustering with Euclidean distance
- Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Data cleaning and outlier detection (IQR method)
2. Exploratory analysis of rating distributions
3. Unsupervised learning for audience segmentation
4. Correlation and variance analysis
5. Visualization of key relationships

**Limitations**:
- Future dates could distort temporal analysis
- Missing creator data limits attribution analysis
- Lack of demographic data prevents deeper segmentation
